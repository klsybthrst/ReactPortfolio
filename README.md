<h1>React Portfolio</h1>
Responsively Designed Portfolio

<h2>Description and Motivation</h2>
<p>This is my responsive portfolio. Using the navbar, the user can switch between three connected pages, home, portfolio and contact. The home page introduces the user to myself. Portfolio shows the user various projects I will have worked on. Finally, on the contact page if the user wishes to connect or contact me they can do so by clicking on either icons. The motivation behind this page is to be employer ready once this bootcamp is over. I will be able to show my work on a page powered and designed by myself.</p>
